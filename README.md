### LoadingZ

A recreation of <a href="https://youtu.be/KfFnMh-KYHI?t=550">some loading screens mini-games from old Dragon Ball games</a>, made in Flutter, using the Flame Library.
This was my first time using Flame and Flutter's external libraries in general, and this project was very fun and challenging!

### How to Run

You will need <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter</a>, after booting up on your emulator or device and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab">starting a new Flutter project</a>, you will transfer the files of this repository to the folder of your Flutter project.

Here are some screenshots of the project running:
